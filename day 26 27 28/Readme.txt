A Decision Tree is a machine learning model used for classification and regression tasks. It works by splitting data into subsets based on feature values, which leads to a tree-like structure of decisions.

Root Node: Represents the entire dataset. It’s where the first split happens based on a feature that best separates the data.

Branches: Represent the outcome of a decision (or split) based on a feature’s value. Each branch splits the data into subsets.

Internal Nodes: Represent features used to make decisions (splits) based on the data.

Leaf Nodes: Represent the final output or decision. For classification, it’s the class label; for regression, it’s the predicted value.

The goal is to create a model that accurately predicts the target variable by breaking down the dataset into more homogeneous subsets.

Advantages:

Easy to interpret and visualize.
Can handle both numerical and categorical data.
Requires little data preprocessing.
Disadvantages:

Prone to overfitting, especially with very deep trees.
Can be unstable with small changes in data.
Decision Trees can be further refined and optimized using techniques like pruning, or by combining multiple trees in ensemble methods such as Random Forests or Gradient Boosting Machines.
