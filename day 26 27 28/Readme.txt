DECISION TREE :-

A Decision Tree is a machine learning model used for classification and regression tasks. It works by splitting data into subsets based on feature values, which leads to a tree-like structure of decisions.

Root Node: Represents the entire dataset. It’s where the first split happens based on a feature that best separates the data.

Branches: Represent the outcome of a decision (or split) based on a feature’s value. Each branch splits the data into subsets.

Internal Nodes: Represent features used to make decisions (splits) based on the data.

Leaf Nodes: Represent the final output or decision. For classification, it’s the class label; for regression, it’s the predicted value.

The goal is to create a model that accurately predicts the target variable by breaking down the dataset into more homogeneous subsets.

Advantages:
- Easy to interpret and visualize.
- Can handle both numerical and categorical data.
- Requires little data preprocessing.

Disadvantages:
- Prone to overfitting, especially with very deep trees.
- Can be unstable with small changes in data.
- Decision Trees can be further refined and optimized using techniques like pruning, or by combining multiple trees in ensemble methods such as Random Forests or 


RANDOM FOREST :-

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method used for classification and regression tasks. It builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to make more accurate and robust predictions.

Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging): Random Forest uses a technique called bagging to create multiple decision trees. It generates different subsets of the training data by sampling with replacement (i.e., bootstrapping).

Random Feature Selection: When constructing each decision tree, a random subset of features is considered for each split. This helps in reducing correlation among trees and makes the model more robust.

Tree Construction: Each decision tree in the forest is built independently using the bootstrapped data and the randomly selected features.

Aggregation: For classification tasks, the Random Forest aggregates the predictions from all individual trees by majority voting (i.e., the class with the most votes is chosen). For regression tasks, it takes the average of all tree predictions.

Advantages:
- Robustness: Less prone to overfitting compared to a single decision tree.
- Versatility: Can handle both numerical and categorical data.
- Feature Importance: Provides a measure of feature importance, which helps in understanding the data.

Disadvantages:
- Complexity: More complex and less interpretable compared to a single decision tree.
- Computationally Intensive: Requires more computational resources and memory, especially with a large number of trees.
- Random Forests are widely used in practice due to their accuracy and ability to handle various types of data.
