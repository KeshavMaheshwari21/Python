REGRESSION :-

Regression is a statistical technique used to model and analyze the relationships between a dependent variable (outcome) and one or more independent variables (predictors or features). The primary goal of regression is to understand how changes in the independent variables affect the dependent variable and to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.


LINEAR REGRESSION :-

Linear Regression is a statistical method used for predicting a continuous outcome variable (dependent variable) based on one or more input features (independent variables). The goal is to model the relationship between the features and the outcome variable with a linear equation.

Linear Relationship: Linear Regression assumes that the relationship between the input features and the outcome variable can be expressed as a linear equation.

Model Training: Linear Regression is trained using techniques such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), which aims to find the best-fitting line by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values.

Evaluation: The performance of the model is often evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure how well the model fits the data.

Advantages:
- Simplicity: Easy to implement and interpret.
- Efficiency: Computationally efficient, even with large datasets.
- Foundation: Forms the basis for more complex regression techniques.

Disadvantages:
- Linearity Assumption: Assumes a linear relationship between the features and the outcome variable, which may not capture complex patterns.
- Outliers: Sensitive to outliers, which can significantly affect the model's performance.

Linear Regression is widely used in various fields, including economics, finance, and science, due to its simplicity and effectiveness in modeling relationships between variables.
