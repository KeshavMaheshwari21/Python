LOGISTIC REGRESSION :-

Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to predict one of two possible outcomes based on input features. Despite its name, it's a classification algorithm, not a regression algorithm.

Logistic Function: Logistic Regression uses the logistic function (also known as the sigmoid function) to model the probability of a binary outcome. The logistic function transforms the linear combination of the input features into a probability value between 0 and 1.

Probability Estimation: The output of the logistic function is interpreted as the probability of the positive class (usually coded as 1). If the probability is greater than a threshold (typically 0.5), the prediction is class 1; otherwise, it's class 0.

Model Training: Logistic Regression is trained using maximum likelihood estimation. The algorithm finds the best-fitting parameters (coefficients) for the model by maximizing the likelihood of the observed data given the model.

Advantages:
- Simplicity: Easy to understand and implement.
- Probabilistic Interpretation: Provides probabilities for the predicted outcomes.
- Efficiency: Computationally efficient and performs well with linearly separable data.

Disadvantages:
- Linearity Assumption: Assumes a linear relationship between input features and the log odds of the outcome, which may not capture complex patterns.
- Binary Outcome: Primarily designed for binary classification, though it can be extended to multi-class problems using techniques like One-vs-Rest or Softmax.

Logistic Regression is a fundamental technique in machine learning and statistics, often used as a baseline model due to its simplicity and interpretability.
